// Beginning of the file
// I need to write plan for my work, for project.

projectPlan = {
    "html-templates": "done",
    "express": "started",
    "pug": "started",
    "database": "false",
    "GoogleMapAPI": "false",
    "LoginUsers": "false",
    "WebsiteDesign": "false",
    "ApplicationLogic": "false"
};

// What is the problem?
// Why is it going so slowly?
let problem = {
    dontWantToDoIt: undefined,
    dontHaveIdeaHowToDoIt: undefined

};

let obstacles = {
    clientJavascript: "I dont know what to do with it",
    database: "I need to start reading and going through Nicos tutorial",
    database1: "I need to create as simple as posible collections",
};

let solutions = {
    database: "Maybe I should just start creating database and it will lead me to other solutions",
    websiteDesign: "When I have break I can think or do research about my website Design or Application logic idea"
};

I need to implement whole my life into programming
then it will give result.

I can create plan in the form of JSON and track there how Im following the plan. 
I can create tracking or planning application.
Its a good idea to materialize thoughts on paper or by typing in file, just like this one.
